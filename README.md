[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/c912eda0-6a43-43d5-a389-1daf42596155/849724/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/gprevost/docker-estored)

Installation
============

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

2. Retrieve the project from the Bitbucket repository: https://bitbucket.org/guillaumeprevost/docker-estored

3. Copy `env` file into `.env` file
	
	```
	cp env .env
	```

4. If you have a PKCS12 SSL certificate, copy it into the top directory as 'keystore.p12'.  

	*CERTIFICATES GENERATED THIS WAY ARE NOT SECURED AND ARE NOT TO BE USED IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.*  
	If you don't have an SSL certificate, you can generate a self-signed one using makecerts:

	```
	docker-compose build makecerts
	docker-compose run makecerts
	```

	This should create a SSL self-signed certificate stored into a key store file 'keystore.p12' with a default password 'keystorepw'.

5. Register your application with AAF Rapid Connect. This is required to be able to use AAF authentication in the Web Application.

	- Go to https://rapid.aaf.edu.au (or https://rapid.test.aaf.edu.au in a non-production context) and click on "Register your service"
	- Log in if needed (using your AAF credentials) Follow the instructions
	- Fill in the form to register the service with AAF Rapid connect (the URL should be https://YOUR.WEB.SERVER.IP:8443, and the callback URL should be https://YOUR.WEB.SERVER.IP:8443/auth/jwt. The other fields are up to you)
	- Remember what you enter in the "secret" field as you will need this in your configuration
	- Remember the URL generated by AAF Rapid Connect when you successfully register the service as you will need this in your configuration  

6. Set up Vislets repository

eStoRED is using a MyTardis repository to store and curate Vislets (snippets of code used for visualising data). You can either use an existing instance of MyTardis storing some Vislets [TODO: add address of repository available]. In that case, skip to the next step. The other option is to set up your own repository following the instructions below:

6.1 - Install MyTardis: https://github.com/ianedwardthomas/docker-mytardis
6.2 - Log into MyTardis as an administrator
6.3 - Create a metadata schema for datafiles with a key-value pair where the key is "handled-data-type" and the value is a String.
6.4 - Create an Experiment and upload your visualisers into Datasets of this MyTardis Experiment. You need to make the Vislet files publicly available for eStoRED to access them.
6.5 - Add metadata "handled-data-type" field using the schema defined in step 6.3 to the Vislet files to define which MIME type they handle (one Vislet can handle multiple MIME types). So far, eStoRED limits data types to: text/plain, text/csv, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json

7. Edit `.env` file to set properties as needed:

	- SSL_KEYSTORE_FILE: reference your SSL key store file (it can be a path, relative to the root of the project). If it was generated by makecerts, the name of the key - store file will be keystore.p12
	- SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: edit the key store password. If it was generated by makecerts, put here the password you have entered
	- SSL_KEY_ALIAS: edit the key alias to your key alias. If it was generated by makecerts, the key alias will be estored
	- RABBITMQ_BROKER_ADDRESS: the address of the the RabbitMQ broker
	- RABBITMQ_BROKER_HOST: the host name of the RabbitMQ broker
	- RABBITMQ_USER: username of the RabbitMQ user having READ and WRITE permissions on the RabbitMQ Virtual Host 'e-stored'
    - RABBITMQ_USER_PASSWORD: password of the RabbitMQ user having READ and WRITE permissions on the RabbitMQ Virtual Host 'e-stored'
    - RABBITMQ_CONSUMER= username of the RabbitMQ user having READ ONLY permissions on the RabbitMQ Virtual Host 'e-stored'
    - RABBITMQ_CONSUMER_PASSWORD= password of the RabbitMQ user having READ ONLY permissions on the RabbitMQ Virtual Host 'e-stored'
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: This value will be used to create a password for the 'root' user on the MySQL server
	- These values will be used by the MySQL server to create a database and user/password with privileges on this database AND by the web server to connect to this database.
	- MYSQL_DATABASE: the name of the e-StorEd database in the MySQL server  
	- MYSQL_USER: the e-StorEd database user (used by the web application to connect to MySQL)  
	- MYSQL_PASSWORD: the password for e-StorEd database user (used by the web application to connect to MySQL)  
	- MYSQL_URL: the connection string used by the web application to connect to MySQL database
	- ESTORED_KENLET_REPOSITORY_HOST: Kenlets repository host machine, where the eStoRED application will look for data visualisers to use (typically 0.0.0.0).
	- ESTORED_KENLET_REPOSITORY_URL: Kenlets repository API endpoint (typically https://0.0.0.0/api/v1/).
	- ESTORED_KENLET_REPOSITORY_NAME: Name of the visualisers repository name (default: Vislets).
	- AAF_URL: Generated by  AAF Rapid Connect upon registration of the service at https://rapid.aaf.edu.au/
	- AAF_SECRET: the password you defined during registration of your service with AAF Rapid Connect
	- AAF_ISSUER: the issuer of AAF tokens (https://rapid.aaf.edu.au, or https://rapid.test.aaf.edu.au if using the Test environment of AAF Rapid Connect)
	- AAF_AUDIENCE= the e-Stored web server address (typically https://0.0.0.0:8443)

8. Build *OR* retrieve the images.

	If you want to retrieve pre-built images from the Docker Hub, use the *pull* command:

	```
	docker-compose pull
	```

	If you want to rebuild the Docker images from the project use the *build* command:
	
	```
	docker-compose build
	```

9. Create and start the containers
	
	```
	docker-compose up -d
	```

Everything should be up and running a few seconds or minutes later.  
  
You should be able to access the web application at: https://YOUR.WEB.SERVER.IP:8443  


Docker images used
==================

The official MySQL docker image is used without modification.  
Complete documentation of the MySQL Docker imqge at: https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/  
  
A modified version of the official RabbitMQ Docker image is used, in order to enable SSL.  
Complete documentation of the official RabbitMQ image at: https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/  
  
The eStoRED image is a Spring Boot web application with an embedded Tomcat server, based on the official Java 8 Docker image.  
Complete documentation of the official Java image: https://hub.docker.com/_/java/  
Tomcat documentation: http://tomcat.apache.org/  
Spring Boot Documentation: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/  

The makecerts image generates a self-signed SSL certificate to get the application up and running for development and demonstration purposes. Such certificates are not to be used on a production environment.
